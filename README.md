# Auto-Insurance-Fraud-Detection
This documents the journey undertaken to build an effective predictive model capable of
distinguishing fraudulent claims from legitimate ones. Leveraging a real-world dataset, the project
employs feature engineering, model selection, performance evaluation, and interpretation of results.
I began this project by meticulously addressing data preprocessing challenges, including outlier handling,
feature selection, and scaling. The report elaborates on the rationale behind each step, emphasizing the
importance of effective feature engineering in model performance. The heart of the report lies in the
meticulous selection and training of machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Logistic
Regression, Gradient Boosting, SVM, Decision Tree, and XGBoost. A detailed exposition delves into the
mechanisms and parameters of each model, analyzing their performance across multiple metrics,
including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC. The comprehensive analysis of ROC AUC
values and the trade-offs between precision and recall further refines the model selection process.
